    <h1>Failed To Send WAKE-ON-LAN Packet</h1>
    <p>
        The following exception was thrown on the attempt to send a WOL packet to your host.
        This could be an error with your target host setup, or it could be an issue with your network
        connection.
     </p>
     <p>
        If the host has worked before it is probably a network issue. Remember that WOL packets are broadcast,
        and usually this means you must be on the same local area network via WiFi as the host you are
        trying to wake up.
